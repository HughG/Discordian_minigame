=== Glass DBs

* Chat up Sand -> Contrariety?
* Carefully limited info on Lands of Glass, and their knowledge of Creation.

(Later, once the Contrariety develops, the one who suggested the foray decides it's a terrible idea and they should be isolationist.  And the others are just confused.  The PCs may meet them again south of the Yellow River, near another deposit, or Lutar, or even Moonsilver manse.)

== Meet Ragara Speyna folks again?


== Meet "Lost" God along Yellow River

* If travelling over-land, rather than through Lands of Glass.

* Was stripped of purview via unusual use of Terminal Sanction, then it was plced under seal of Jupiter.  He was left with no job, to erase the paperwork, so doesn't know what to do.
** Could just pick something, but doesn't understand that.
** Used to be guardian god of a First Age weapons cache.  Empress arranged for it to be "lost", for her later use.
