Based in a Kingdom in NE, sized by both DB sides, which would rather just be left alone. Sent on mission to get some tech smuggled out of moonstone manse, via Creation-friendly (but secretly Void-cultist) contact in Lutar. (Said contact thinks spreading bio-tech will please the Void Lords. In fact they won't care one way or the other, if it's just spread to Creation mortals, but contact didn't realise that.)

Kingdom wants to use it to defend themselves, either directly or by selling it to one DB side or the other for protection. They think they know what it does (make up something good) but it's something else.

In fact someone will try to switch it for vials of Contrariety.

Also, there's a ronin Sidereal of Secrets who's trying to get into the Starmetal manse to mess with the Breaking of the Mask. PCs could help either by pretending to be Alchemicals and getting access, it having Echoes of one of the Circle. He/She may need a hearthstone or other magic to keep stuff secret from Jupiter.

There will be DBs from one or both sides stumbling upon them, possibly trying to kill them, or to manipulate/recruit them. Maybe Dreya's Solar-ised friend in the NE? Maybe raksha?
