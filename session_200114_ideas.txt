== Meta

* Crow will also have noticed Shaping (Ascending Destinies, though he won't
know the term) on himself (to "find the cause of the causality break in
Benimar at [time of exaltation]"; from Unma) and the female slave (to escape
slavery; from Kolrei, as destiny connecting to the PCs).

* Map may be an object sent by Kolrei using "Predestined Delivery Shaping"
Charm. 


== Timed

* Metagalapa (15th Asc. Air)
* Scarlet Empress' scream, as ring is removed (??? Asc. Air)


== Metagalapa

* Metagalapa moving straight towards them, at ~20mph and rising!

* Travel by Huraka (Core, p. 304)?  Maybe one owes Kolrei a favour (for trinket for Green Frowning Bear, RoGD I p. 91).

* Heart of Darkness will
** know that defenses deactivated because they recognised the Green Lady;
** know that Ash isn't the GL;
** since she's "a Lady of the Green, going as Ash", suspect it's something
like the trick the Dowager was trying to pull off;
** tell her (but not the rest) what they're up to;
** not let her come along, as she's not powerful enough yet, and "someone
in Creation should know what they did, in case the Quincunx falls";
** warn them not to trust agents of Heaven too easily (he's assuming they already know about Sidereals).


== Triggered

* Kolrei
** Trigger: any PC shows signs of exaltation, after the exaltation scene.
*** Leave note: "A friend is watching over you."
*** Appear to PCs in private; intro self.
*** Believes: PCs from Pole of Glass? (Not convinced.)
*** Wants: non-Yu-Shan allies; exaltation info; prophecy info; Achthn contacts; Mask revealed.
*** Offers: support; spying; starmetal weapon for Stands.


== Next town/tavern

* News
** Metagalapa started moving!
** Ancestor shrines burning.


=== Meet some DBs from Pole of Glass (optional)

* glass copse -> Pole of Glass portal
* DBs come out: explore/trade (Lutar)
* Contrariety

Cabal comes to a copse of crystal trees.  Looks like demesne; actually portal to Lands of Glass.  (Crow's Charm could sense it; anima power will reveal you need to be a certain kind of being (Glass DB) to open it.)

Some DBs (all Ess 3) will come out through it, seeking trade and exploration.  One unknowingly has Contrariety.  They'll chat, and indeed get it on with any of the characters, specially if they realise they're Exalted!

All Hakkano:
* Atsuko (female, lead); tall, slim, blond, good-looking; negotiator, navigator
* Bouri (male), medium height, slender; muscle, larceny
* Emmena (female), medium height, solid build; craft, war, backup muscle

(Later, once the Contrariety develops, the one who suggested the foray decides it's a terrible idea and they should be isolationist.  And the others are just confused.  The PCs may meet them again south of the Yellow River, near another deposit, or Lutar, or even Moonsilver manse.)


== Great Forks

* Compass I - Scavenger Lands: Ch. 4, plus Ch. 8 p. 139+ for gods.
** Dayshield most likely to encounter/seek PCs if they show Exalted-ness, other than Do-Fen Jye.

* Government: the Three; Ministers (DBs); Enforcers (incl. spirits & God-bloods)

* Center: temples; university SW
* N: menials, thieves
* E: barracks (empty-ish)
* S: warehouses, docks
* W: drug manufacture
