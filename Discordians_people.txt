== People and Groups

with motivations


=== Mortals

==== Confederacy Representatives

Some member of the Confederacy (TODO) has learned that Benimar is looking for something, and that the kingdom reckons it might tip the balance for them. They don't know what is sought, but they know which caravan to watch.  They also know the source of Benimar's intel (TODO), so they're inclined to believe it's (moderate) importance.  Mortal spies (also posing as traders) have been sent to intercept.


==== Neighbouring kingdoms?

==== The Guild

If the group ever gets to their intended trading point, they'll find a corrupt (natch) Guild factor, Mayga Cordolu.  She's trying to sell off the weakest and most useless slaves at what is apparently a good price, after dosing them with just enough remedies (or even actual magic) to make them look worth it.  She has a couple of low-level DB and spirit sidekicks.  She has no other notable malice, just the usual Guild avarice, but may try to get involved if she gets wind of the secret mission.  Someone in her employ may be a carrier of Contrariety, and may spread it to the group's caravan (if they're still with them at that point).

===== Motivations

* Make Money Fast!



=== Dragon-Blooded

==== Family Speyna (House Ragara)

This family is technically still on the Empress' side but is looking to expand its options.  They think that her going straight for a union with a Greater Elemental Dragon of the new pole, without (apparently) the blessing of the relevant directional Dragon, bespeaks desperation and is probably too much of a risk.  They are travelling to Great Forks, for drug and other trades, and to divest themselves of some slaves -- partly for economic reasons but also to put out feelers for a possible alliance with the Lady Risha's agents!

The group may encounter Ragara Speyna Moro (Essence 3, Water-Aspect), a reasonably experienced trader and fighter, along with a couple of other DB family members and a bunch highly-trained mortal Henchmen etc.  Probably one or two spirits pressured into helping them.  Unknown to them, the family will denounce them as traitors if the wrong people find out about their true mission.

===== Motivations

* Protect their family.  Enhance the family assets, short-term and long-term.
* Get themselves some powerful allies and/or escape routes, with minimal risk.
* ... oh yeah, and serve true ruler of the Realm, blah, blah, blah.


==== Latan Weyzo

This Fire-Aspect outcaste does mercenary work mainly along the Yellow River.  He's not aligned with any houses, mainly because he's too impulsive and short-sighted to be useful to them.  He does his job acceptably but may be a liability to the PCs if they have to call on him.  He owes a few favours to the Kingdom and will re-pay them, but won't risk his life (those of his Henchman, sure).  He commands skilled soldiers and can rustle up some spirits and maybe another minor DB.  He will provide a talisman which the group can break to request his aid; he should be able to get to them in less than a day, with spirit-aided travel.

Latan is, unusually, still somewhat attached to the idea of "anathema" as a bad thing -- more from general chaos recently than attachment to Immaculate faith -- and may end up causing trouble for the PCs if they reveal themselves.  Calling a Wyld Hunt would be pointless but he may shop them to local authorities/powers, if he can find grounds for doing so which won't put him in bad standing with Benimar.

===== Motivations

* Stay alive.
* The thrill of combat.
* Prove himself worthy to be adopted by a Dragon-Blooded House.


=== Lunar

???


=== Sidereal

==== Kolrei Twice-Exalted, Chosen of Secrets

A ronin on the run from the Bureau of Secrets.  He has a Sidereal manse with a Fate/scrying shield, and a hearthstone which makes any Resplendent Destiny he wears just as effective against Sidereals as other people (or more so?).  He was taken in and started training, when he and his mentor learned that, according to prophecy in "The Apocalypse Coda", he was destined to write ... "The Apocalypse Coda", an addition to the Dragonwife Cycle.  He knew just enough about the Cycle to escape before anybody tried to kill him off.

He'll be using Astrology of the Mask (... or, one of the other ones?) to stay hidden while watching others.

===== Motivations

* To stay alive.

* To find out how he's supposed to write this Coda, without reading the rest
of the Cycle, and decide whether he wants to or not; and what to put in it.

* To find out why he was named "Twice-Exalted" by his mentor etc.

* Keeping an eye out for allies.


==== Unma in Sable, Chosen of Endings

Bronze faction, trying vainly to keep anathema in check and stop them from causing the wrong endings.  Currently assigned to investigate a strange gap in some threads in the Loom, and also to keep an eye out for Kolrei.


===== Motivations

* Keep the worst damage of the "anathema" in check, even though things are falling apart.



=== Solar

Ghost Dog has been sent by Baruko Lu-Yi to covertly help the Speyna mission: to avoid them getting killed; to avoid word of their treachery reaching the wrong ears; and maybe to pick up some info (from the Speyna or from Risha's people) on other things he could be doing to pull more DB forces away from the Empress.

==== Motivations

* Serve his master (and be a good example of good service by doing so).
* Protect family Speyna.  Gather intel on splits in the Empress' forces.
