=== Meet some DBs from Pole of Glass (optional)

The now-cabal may come across a strange copse of crystal trees.  They may take it for a manse or demesne, but in fact it's an intrusion from the Lands of Glass.

Some DBs (TODO: names, description) will be travelling out through it, looking for general trade and exploration.  One of them is carrying Contrariety but doesn't know it.  They are happy to chat, and indeed get it on with any of the characters, specially if they realise they're Exalted!

(Later, once the Contrariety develops, the one who suggested the foray decides it's a terrible idea and they should be isolationist.  And the others are just confused.  The PCs may meet them again south of the Yellow River, near another deposit.)


== Triggered

* Kolrei
** Trigger: any PC shows signs of exaltation, after the exaltation scene.
*** Leave note: "A friend is watching over you."
*** Appear to PCs in private; intro self.
*** Believes: PCs from Pole of Glass? (Not convinced.)
*** Wants: non-Yu-Shan allies; exaltation info; prophecy info; Achthn contacts; Mask revealed.
*** Offers: support; spying; starmetal weapon for Stands.


=== Meet a Guild representative (optional)

Mayga; in Great Forks, or wherever else they end up.  Is looking for a profit any old way, as well as selling her duff slaves, and will happily deal with the cabal if it looks profitable ... or just as happily sell them out.  (TODO: details)

=== Interference on the way

Once they've sussed out where they're going from Great Forks, someone will get wind of it and try to stop/misdirect them.  (TODO: Who?  Autochthonians?)
