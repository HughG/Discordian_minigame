=== Meet some DBs from Pole of Glass (optional)

The now-cabal may come across a strange copse of crystal trees.  They may take it for a manse or demesne, but in fact it's an intrusion from the Lands of Glass.

Some DBs (TODO: names, description) will be travelling out through it, looking for general trade and exploration.  One of them is carrying Contrariety but doesn't know it.  They are happy to chat, and indeed get it on with any of the characters, specially if they realise they're Exalted!

(Later, once the Contrariety develops, the one who suggested the foray decides it's a terrible idea and they should be isolationist.  And the others are just confused.  The PCs may meet them again south of the Yellow River, near another deposit.)


== TODO

* Read up on Great Forks.  Compass I - Scavenger Lands: Ch. 4, plus Ch. 8 p. 139+ for gods.  Dayshield most likely.
