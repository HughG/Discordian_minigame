=== Meet some DBs from Pole of Glass (optional)

* glass copse -> Pole of Glass portal
* DBs come out: explore/trade (Lutar)
* Contrariety

Cabal comes to a copse of crystal trees.  Looks like demesne; actually portal to Lands of Glass.  (Crow's Charm could sense it; anima power will reveal you need to be a certain kind of being (Glass DB) to open it.)

Some DBs (all Ess 3) will come out through it, seeking trade and exploration.  One unknowingly has Contrariety.  They'll chat, and indeed get it on with any of the characters, specially if they realise they're Exalted!

All Hakkano:
* Atsuko (female, lead); tall, slim, blond, good-looking; negotiator, navigator
* Bouri (male), medium height, slender; muscle, larceny
* Emmena (female), medium height, solid build; craft, war, backup muscle

(Later, once the Contrariety develops, the one who suggested the foray decides it's a terrible idea and they should be isolationist.  And the others are just confused.  The PCs may meet them again south of the Yellow River, near another deposit, or Lutar, or even Moonsilver manse.)
