* Empress's Titan shoots past as group disembarks!

** Peleps/Ragara distracted (maybe why crossing was easier)

* Sparrow finds other warhawks to SW of city, concealed.

* Glass DBs: some spirit sees them; invited (just them) to M of Trade, Constantly Smiling

* Ash gets invite to M of Research (spying), Lady Jozakura.  Happy to see another war-hawk; heard rumours of Ash's involvement re Mtglp deflection!

* Sand gets invite to perform at show hosted by [Kari's patron], where Kari will also be present.  They can chat before/during/after, and may feel something different about each other.  Sand's companions welcome.  Marble Hands (Deputy of Trade) will be there.

* Latan Weyzo won't bother initiating contact.  If quizzed re merchant contacts, will say that, as Lost Egg, he's trying to get out of mercenary business and into trade before getting dragged into Realm civil war.  (Has good Melee, War, and utility sorcery.)

** If Veliki etc. dig deeper, will learn he's planning to sell out GF to Nellens, with "spirit exclusion zone bombs"

* Crow may be spotted by a bitter, jealous rival, Darrak Red-Sky.  Will try to steal map.  (Useless without clues, and Kolrei can track it, but he doesn't know that!)

* Do-Fen Jye has been absent since shortly before Calibration, but priests still welcoming travellers/alms.  Layout gives clues.  High Priest will recognise map layout if asked.

** Tirna won't know of Do-Fen Jye but can guide the group to the temple district, where priests in a temple to some gambling god or similar can help them.

== Meet Ragara Speyna folks again?


== Meet "Lost" God along Yellow River

* If travelling over-land, rather than through Lands of Glass.

* Was stripped of purview via unusual use of Terminal Sanction, then it was plced under seal of Jupiter.  He was left with no job, to erase the paperwork, so doesn't know what to do.
** Could just pick something, but doesn't understand that.
** Used to be guardian god of a First Age weapons cache.  Empress arranged for it to be "lost", for her later use.
